    I was introduced to decimal time and thought it was a much more intuitive time system to use. I also stumbled upon Internation Fixed Calendar and thought it was 
    pretty neat. Now whenever people see the widgets on my phone, they can ask me why it's 7.68 or why the date doesn't look right.

    This was made during COVID when we were realizing it's a lot easier to discuss ideas when we had a whiteboard and could all just draw on it. To get around 
    the lack of being able to draw on whiteboards together during COVID, we created a paint app where you could join rooms and draw with your friends.

    A CS course I was taking had "which of the following is not a VSCode extension" as a multiple choice question. Obviously that was too good of an 
    opportunity to pass up so here we are with a VSCode extension with the name of the previously right answer (the question had to be changed to 
    "which of these VSCode extensions has the least downloads")

    We tried to make a Discord bot that plays music and it ended up being able to do everything except for playing music (can pull data for YouTube, etc.) 
    so instead of scrapping it, we decided to submit it as a joke. People like it. We also realized later it was missing intents after Discord API updates
    but at that point, it's too funny to bother fixing.
