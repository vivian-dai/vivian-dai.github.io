Hi guys! I'm Vivian Dai, a computer science student at the University of Waterloo. I enjoy making fun little projects that are either actually make life easier or overcomplicate things in a funny way. This could be a mobile app that uses an unconventional time system or a multi-user drawing tool. Topics that interest me in the field of computers include cybersecurity, Android app development, and machine learning.  <br><br>

Computer science aside, I'm interested in music, photography, theatre, and reading science fiction. Some works I've enjoyed include Ted Chiang's short stories, *All Tomorrows*, and *The Last Question* (no particular order, just random ones that come to mind at the moment).
