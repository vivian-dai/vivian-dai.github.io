Hi guys! I'm Vivian Dai, a computer science student at the University of Waterloo. I enjoy making fun little projects that are either actually make life easier or overcomplicate things in a funny way. This could be a mobile app that uses an unconventional time system or a multi-user drawing tool. You can learn more about things I've done in the [projects](/projects) section of this website. Topics that interest me in the field of computers include cybersecurity, Android app development, and machine learning so I'd like to learn more about these fields. <br><br>

Computer science aside, I'm interested in music, photography (enjoy these random photos I took and put here to take up space), theatre, and reading science fiction. Some works I've enjoyed include Ted Chiang's short stories, *All Tomorrows*, and *The Last Question* (no particular order, just random ones that come to mind at the moment). <br><br>

In my free time, you might find me going on spontaneous bike rides or walks, not sleeping because of a hackathon, CTF, or because I got carried away doing some personal project, or thinking about ideas and concepts that I've come across (sci fi is a good inspiration). <br><br>

I'm currently looking for a fall 2023 co-op so if you find me interesting, don't hesitate to [shoot me an email](mailto:vsqdai@uwaterloo.ca) to request my resume. <br><br>
